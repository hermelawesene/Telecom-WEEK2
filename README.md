Telecom Data Analysis
This repository contains code and scripts for analyzing telecom data, focusing on customer behavior, engagement, user experience, and company growth potential. The project aims to analyze large datasets and provide insights into customer usage, network performance, and strategic recommendations.

Project Structure
Data Analysis: Scripts to handle the analysis of customer engagement, user experience, and growth potential based on telecom data.
Customer Overview: Analysis of telecom customer behavior, popular handset trends, and customer segmentation.
User Engagement: Detailed analysis of customer session durations, data usage, and engagement patterns.
User Experience: Insights into network performance, including metrics like TCP retransmissions and throughput.
Growth Potential & Purchase Recommendation: Evaluation of the company’s growth potential based on the analysis, with a final recommendation on whether to purchase the company.
Features
Customer Overview:

Analysis of telecom customers, focusing on handset models and manufacturers.
Identifies key trends and patterns in customer behavior.
User Engagement:

Analyzes session durations, data usage, and customer interaction frequency.
Segments customers into clusters based on engagement metrics.
User Experience:

Evaluates metrics related to session duration, TCP retransmissions, and network throughput.
Provides insights into user satisfaction based on network performance data.
Growth Potential & Purchase Recommendation:

Assesses the company’s potential for growth based on user data.
Includes a recommendation on whether to proceed with a company purchase.
How to Use
Data Preparation:

Prepare the telecom dataset in CSV, Excel, or other supported formats.
Ensure that all necessary features (e.g., session duration, data usage, engagement metrics) are present for analysis.
Run the Analysis Scripts:

Use Python scripts provided in this repository to analyze the data.
Generate key insights such as customer segmentation, network performance metrics, and growth potential.
Customize:

Modify the analysis scripts to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
Installation

Install the required Python packages using requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the analysis scripts:

bash
Copy code
python analysis_script.py
Requirements
Python 3.x: For running the analysis scripts.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

SQLAlchemy: For database interactions (if applicable).

MLFlow: For tracking the experiments and model versions (if used).

Install these packages using requirements.txt or directly via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib sqlalchemy mlflow
Limitations
The analysis depends heavily on data completeness and quality. Missing data in key columns may lead to inaccurate conclusions.
Customization of scripts may be required depending on the structure of your dataset.
Future Work
Improve data quality checks and automate missing value handling.
Add more advanced machine learning models to predict customer behavior.
Extend analysis to cover other areas like churn prediction.
